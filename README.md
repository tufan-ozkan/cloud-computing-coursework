# Cloud Computing Coursework - CENG 495

This repository contains my assignments completed for the Cloud Computing course at Middle East Technical University (Spring 2024â€“2025). The projects demonstrate practical experience with cloud platforms, container orchestration, distributed processing, and microservices.

## Projects Overview

### 1. E-commerce Web Application  
A full-stack web app deployed on Vercel, using MongoDB Atlas for NoSQL database services.  
Implements user roles, item catalog with filtering, ratings, and reviews.  

### 2. Kubernetes Microservices  
An e-commerce system decomposed into microservices, containerized with Docker and deployed on Kubernetes (Minikube).  
Includes deployment automation with Skaffold and integration of a local AI chatbot.  

### 3. Distributed MapReduce with Celery  
A distributed MapReduce pipeline implemented in Python using Celery and Redis to analyze the Spotify Songs dataset.  
Demonstrates task orchestration with Celery chains, groups, and chords.
